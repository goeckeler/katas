# Coding Katas

My personal catalogue of katas that I actually performed during coding dojos or which I prepared for such events. Serves to get you quickly started with your own sessions. 

## How to read?

The folder layout is roughly as follows:

+ **katas** contains the catalogue of katas that can be used with different constraints, e.g. Fizz Buzz, Tennis, and so on.  
+ **lessons** contains the catalogue of constraints and objectives like Object Calisthenics, Refactoring and so on to use in a real session on one of the above katas.

## Which kata for what?

Simple katas are good to train basics and to reflect what you are actually doing and to learn completely new stuff or languages.

We applied baby steps on **FizzBuzz**, used no mouse or trackpad on **Anagrams**, played ping pong driver and navigator on **String Calculator**, or learned a bit of Scala with **99 bottles of beer**. Rinse and repeat with **Histograms** or **Roman numbers**.

Advanced katas however need a bit of a different setup.

### Refactor

Refactor legacy code with **Golden Master** or improve the famous **Gilded Rose**.

### Design

Try to execute a simple kata with an introductory **Pen and Paper** session.

### Coding Style

Have a go at **Object Calisthenics** or try to be **SOLID** on a simple kata.

### Running System

Unlike other dojos this is a bit unfriendly and also like a competition. You need to change the code while the system is running. Let's you focus on what's next, I mean what is really next, and remember that only the running system makes the money.

## Credits

Please keep in mind, although some katas can be attributed to me, or at least the version contained herein, most katas are cloned or copied from others or at least described somewhere else.

If you are looking for the original katas or even some more, I recommend to start with (in this order):

- Emily Bache's Catalogue at https://github.com/emilybache
- Dave Thomas' Catalogue at http://codekata.com/

Have fun coding!
