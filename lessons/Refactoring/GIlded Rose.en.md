## Introduction 

We have just been hired to maintain a productive system. The customer has new requirements. A common situation in a programmer's live. A short glance at the code, and we know this code needs some refinement and urgent refactoring before we start to extend it. However, before we set out to perform this we definitely need an automatic test.
  
Okay, we need some good ideas. Bring the system under test. The customer already specified the requirements, we can start from there for the first couple of test cases. On top we have the running code. The application is live, the customer is satisfied with what he has got. We can assume that the application does exactly what the customer wants, no matter what the specification says.

## Challenges

- How to add an automatic test as soon as possible?
- Do I start refactoring the code, then I add new features, or the other way round?
- When to use a Golden Master, when not?
- Which refactorings help most?
- How to make the code more readable in less than two hours?
