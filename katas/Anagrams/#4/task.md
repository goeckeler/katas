# Word Puzzle #

Another game where anagrams are useful is "how many words are in the word?". 

So if you use all the characters or any subset thereof of any given word, how many words can you form with these characters?

Normally a word is regarded a word in this context if it consists of at least three characters. Shorter ones like "it", "be", "a" are regarded as too easy.

How many words are there in "arrest"?
