Lambdas Katas
-------------

+ Language: Java
+ Level: Intermediate
+ Requires: Java 1.8+, JUnit 4.12+, IDE recommended

## Objective

With the advent of Java 8 the language itself gets a facelift, namely Lambdas and Streams amongst others. These katas will help you get a basic grip of these new features.

## Katas

Depending on how you tend to learn there are currently two katas available, not just one.

### Business

This kata focusses on how you would use Lambdas and Streams in everyday use through the means of a small application dealing with actors and films.

### Labs

This is a technical kata originally run in a JFokus 2015  session ([http://www.jfokus.se/](http://www.jfokus.se/)). Starting easy it gets deeps into what you can do with lambdas and streams from a technical point, but keep in mind - it will make you think about the edges when not to use these features.

### Speed

This is a demo, not a kata. But you can make it a kata about how to perform microbenching. It simply searches a list for the first matching item, in sequential functional style, in parallel functional style, and in a classical for loop. Go and find out which is really the fastest and when.
