# Mini Code Retreat
  
+ Language: Any with decent support for unit tests, e.g. Java, Scala, PHP, C# or Go
+ Level: Easy
+ Requires: git or Mercurial, IDE recommended

## Motivation

You may have visited a Code Retreat already. If not, it is a day long coding event. You run four to five sessions always with the same kata. After each session you basically throw away your code. Each session starts with a new set of constraints.

Enter the Mini Code Retreat.

In this kata we will run two to three sessions. Instead of deleting the kata you stash it away so you can discuss your approach with the others. Then you can expunge it.

## Objective
  
Open your mind. Embrace different ways to solve an issue. Try remote pairing. Have fun. End of marketing.

Actually this kata focus on trying out things in different ways, and you can change the constraints like you want. You can even run this kata as a Code Retreat with five sessions. There is a special focus on Baby Steps and writing meaningful tests.

## Sessions

### Nearly usual

Start with a standard session of test-driven development. As we only have three sessions try to get into master and apprentice mode. That is one knows the language, the other is a noob.

If you have guys pairing remotely this is the session to ensure the setup is working, and you should pair off-site with on-site.

### Silent pairing

No talking. Only the code is allowed to speak. Do not delete new tests immediately. Remind yourself that one codes the test, the other just writes enough code to get the test green. Pass the keyboard. Refactor. Hand over and write a new test.

### Green or Revert

You've got 2 minutes. No more, no less. After two minutes the code must compile, is tested, and the test is green. If not revert to the last good state, even if that is no code at all. Start again. By the way ... commit often, that really helps.

A variant is that each pair takes its own time, still two minutes. You code must comply to those rules within that period, but you can be faster and then start a new time slot.

## Coding

The standard kata for a retreat is always the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Game of Life"). Well, just for a change give [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe "Tic Tac Toe") a chance.

Actually you can take any simple kata that takes more than 20 minutes to code. It must be impossible to complete the kata so you can tackle different aspects in each session if you want to. It is also okay to revisit the first approach and make it better.
