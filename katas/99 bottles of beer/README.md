## Story

You are required to sing the song of beer. If you have enough time, you can sing the complete song. If you are thirsty, then make it shorter.

However, you have a sore throat. Beer might help. All the boys are shouting. No song, no beer. Now, the boys are a bit drunk, so instead of singing you offer to prompt the song text. Karaoke style. Perfect!

Mind, you will get drunk, too. So your computer will need to prompt the text.
